Tools for Machine Learning built using Python. Currently regression and classification models with gradient descent can be created. For regression, the mean squared error, L1 (epsilon insentive) and L2 (squared epsilon insentive) loss functions can be used. For classification, hinge, squared hinge and cross entropy (logistics) loss functions are also available. Regularization can be performed with the L1 or L2 norm, or a mix of both with the "Elastic" regularizer. The most commond activation functions (linear, ReLU, eLU, leaky ReLU, softplus, sigmoid, tanh, softmax) are also already coded, but only the softmax function gets used for the classification models.
