Tools for Machine Learning built using Python. Currently regression and classification models with gradient descent can be created. 
For regression the following loss functions can be used:

  -mean squared error
  -L1 (epsilon insentive) 
  -L2 (squared epsilon insentive)

For classification, in addition to the three above, the following loss functions can also be used:

  -hinge
  -squared hinge
  -cross entropy (logistics function) 

Regularization can be performed with the L1 or L2 norm, or a mix of both with the "Elastic" regularizer. 

The most common activation functions are also available: 

  -linear
  -ReLU
  -eLU
  -leaky ReLU
  -softplus
  -sigmoid
  -tanh
  -softmax
